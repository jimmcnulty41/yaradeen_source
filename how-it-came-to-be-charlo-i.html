    <h1>Songmanship & Ancient Translations</h1>
    <i>Dr. Jordi Camlinson</i>
    <p>

    If we examine Roduram/Auglish translations with a lens toward the social and political context present during the time of the translation, we can begin to see a larger story of the relationship between the two species, as well as major changes happening within each population as a result of major historical events. Prior to Sunocdeth, we can see distinct differences between the Nurian Remnants and New Reyoran populations in the style of their translations, with the former preferring to accurately reflect structural elements (rhymes, sonic patterns, etc.) in their translations, and the latter focusing more on accurate translation of the literal words. After the Rennaissance, changes in the proportion of the Roduram population that resulted in a greater number of scholars meant that the major works that were translated into Auglish tended to skew more toward prose as opposed to music, and the differences between the different Auglish cultures became more about _which_ works were translated as opposed to _how_ they were translated.

          ah ask how asking me how it came to be
      quiet now listen now listen to trees

      first hush was only hush land and the sea
      waves hush made rain hush of thousands of seeds
      none hush took root hush till Great Ari Tree
      two hush leaves grew hush the sun power seek

      one two three four flowers grew from the stems
      and fell from the blossoms seeds to root again

      from new seeds grew elders, creators of we
      and still ever growing the Great Ari Tree

      they took from it seeds for to make the great forest
      then made their own seeds when sang their own chorus

      naa'fen and naa'leen naa'la with their seed
      sa'ben and sa'feen saa'la with their seed

      in the great tree branches elders found grown
      feathered and furred ones who called it their home

      they took from it pets for to

      saa'ven and naa'fen aa'fen with their kin
      saa'ben and naa'leen aa'leen with their kin
